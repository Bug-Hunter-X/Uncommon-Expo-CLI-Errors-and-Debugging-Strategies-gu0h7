The solution often involves carefully reviewing the Expo documentation, checking for dependency conflicts using tools like `npm ls` or `yarn why`, and ensuring all native modules are correctly configured and linked. In some cases, cleaning the project's cache (`expo prebuild --clean`) or reinstalling dependencies might resolve the issue. Advanced scenarios might require analyzing logs for more specific error messages, carefully reviewing the build system configuration (e.g., `app.json`, `package.json`), or even debugging native module issues within Xcode or Android Studio.
