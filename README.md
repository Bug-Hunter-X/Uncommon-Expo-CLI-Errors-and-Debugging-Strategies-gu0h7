# Uncommon Expo CLI Errors and Debugging Strategies

This repository demonstrates a common, yet difficult-to-diagnose error encountered when using the Expo CLI with React Native projects. The error manifests as unexpected build failures, asset processing errors, or strange runtime behavior.  The challenge lies in the complex interplay between Expo's build system and its dependencies.

This repo includes example code showing a common error (expoBug.js), and a solution (expoBugSolution.js). The detailed analysis of the error and solution are explained in the respective files.

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repository.
2. Navigate to the project directory.
3. Run `npm install` or `yarn install`.
4. Examine `expoBug.js` to see the problem.
5. Compare with the solution in `expoBugSolution.js`.
