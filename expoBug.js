This error occurs when using the Expo CLI to manage a React Native project, and it's often related to incorrect configuration or dependency issues.  The exact error message might vary, but it typically involves problems with the project's build system, native modules, or dependencies. For example, you might encounter build failures, errors during asset processing, or unexpected behavior during the development process.  The difficulty in debugging this type of error lies in the complexity of the Expo build process and the wide range of possible causes.
